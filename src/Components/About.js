                      <p>I initially began to code during my third year in the university although i have taken programming courses prior to this as it was part of my syllabus.
                          As someone who is curious and likes to learn new things, i jumped straight in, learning was an interesting and challenging experience.
                          I had to go on break for a while to focus on my studies.<br></br>
                          Fast forward to July 2021 after my graduation(first class honors B.Eng Mechanical Engineering ðŸ˜‰), I participated in KodeCamp internship which ended in December 2021 and also SideHustle internship which
                          lasted for just 6 weeks, specialising in frontend track(HTML,CSS, JavaScript and ReactJs). I Collaborated with product team members to implement new
                            feature developments,worked in groups to build and deliver highly functional web
                            applications,worked as Team Leader; delegated, assigned and supervised
                            tasks amongst members and engaged in debugging activities with other interns during my internship
